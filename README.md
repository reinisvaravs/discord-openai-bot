WALL-E is an intelligent Discord bot built with Node.js and OpenAI. It answers questions using embedded knowledge from structured documents stored in a GitHub repository. The bot is designed to coach OnlyFans creators using internal training content managed by a company called **Wunder**.

Built for maintainability, transparency, and flexibility.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Multiformat Knowledge Embedding**  
  Supports `.txt`, `.md`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, `.html`, `.csv`, and `.yaml`.

- ✅ **Contextual GPT Responses**  
  Uses both user message history and vector-matched content chunks to generate high-quality answers.

- ✅ **GitHub Knowledge Source**

  - Automatically fetches & embeds knowledge from a public GitHub repo
  - Supports periodic auto-refresh and manual `!refresh`

- ✅ **Memory**

  - Keeps up to 5 recent messages in memory for context
  - Does not store long-term history (stateless between restarts)

- ✅ **Admin Controls (prefix-based)**

  - `!bot on` / `!bot off` — toggle response mode
  - `!refresh` — manually re-embed knowledge from GitHub
  - `!source` — show which embedded chunks were used in the last GPT answer
  - `!files` — show filenames used in the last GPT reply
  - `!change channel to <channelId>` — move WALL-E to a new channel

- ✅ **Custom Personality (System Prompt)**

  - Conversational tone
  - Does not act like a model or support bot
  - Follows strict coaching role rules
  - Supports edgy humor, sarcasm, and relaxed chat
  - 🛠️ System prompt is defined inside `server.js`

## 🌐 GitHub Integration

Knowledge is dynamically loaded from:

```
https://github.com/reinisvaravs/discord-bot-test-info
```

- Files must be at root
- Only supported file types are processed
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` to increase API limits (recommended)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reinisvaravs/discord-openai-bot.git
cd discord-openai-bot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create `.env` file

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@host:port/db
REMOTE_PASSWORD=your_custom_remote_password
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not commit `.env` to GitHub. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### 4. Start the bot

```bash
npm start
```

## 🧠 How Knowledge Embedding Works

- At startup, WALL-E fetches all files from GitHub
- Parses and chunks each file (≈ 500 tokens per chunk)
- Embeds each chunk using `text-embedding-3-small`
- On every message, embeds the message and compares it to all known chunks using cosine similarity
- Top 4 chunks are fed into the GPT system prompt

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Run `!refresh` in Discord to force a fresh embed from GitHub
- Use `!source` to view which files/chunks were referenced
- Check console logs for full vector similarity scores + previews

---

## 🧭 Upcoming Features

🟡 File-based knowledge change detection (auto-refresh on updates) [in progress]

🟡 Persistent vector storage with PostgreSQL + pgvector

🟡 Dashboard UI to view logs, sources, vector stats, and bot usage

🟡 Message analytics (track most asked questions, top matched files)

🟡 User-specific context memory (thread/session-based)
